			Dynonamics affirms that <b>it does NOT retain the passwords of users</b>. Users grant Dynonamics the permission to store personal information, including email, API key, and application name. Users grant Dynonamics access to their password only at the beginning until Heroku verifies Dynonamics and provides an API key which permits Dynonamics to adjust the dynos of the user. After this verification process is complete, Dynonamics will permanently discard the password in question. For additional security, users can change their password after Dynonamics has been verified.
